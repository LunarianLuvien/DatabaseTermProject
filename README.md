## Project Overview
This project is focused on creating a detailed transportation database model for a nation, covering various transportation modes such as sea, air, road, mobile transport, and metro systems. It features a system that issues unique transportation cards to citizens, recording their travel histories, search behaviors, and preferences. The database is designed to facilitate a wide array of queries, ranging from very broad to highly specific.

## Project Development
The project commences with the gathering of data requirements from seven distinct transportation providers: Turkish Airlines, TCDD, MartÄ± Tech, Obilet, IDO, IZBAN, and Yolcu360. The process continues with the creation of individual EER diagrams for each provider, which are later merged into a unified comprehensive diagram. The subsequent stages include transforming the conceptual design into a relational model and ultimately implementing the physical database structure.

## Project Contents
Included within the project's source files are:
- Individual EER diagrams for each provider.
- A merged diagram showing their integration.
- Database components such as data entries, triggers, check constraints.
- A variety of query examples designed for extensive testing.
